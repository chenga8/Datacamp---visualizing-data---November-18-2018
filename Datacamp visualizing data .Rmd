## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#All about aesthetics, part 1

# 2 - Reverse: Map cyl to x and mpg to y

# 4 - Change shape and size of the points in the above plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)


```

```{r}
## All about aesthetics, part 2
#Which shape to use? The default geom_point() uses shape = 19 (a solid circle with an outline the same colour as the inside). Good alternatives are shape = 1 (hollow) and shape = 16 (solid, no outline). These all use the col aesthetic (don't forget to set alpha for solid points).

#A really nice alternative is shape = 21 which allows you to use both fill for the inside and col for the outline! This is a great little trick for when you want to map two aesthetics to a dot.

# am and cyl are factors, wt is numeric

##All about attributes, part 1

#A word about shapes: In the exercise "All about aesthetics, part 2", you saw that shape = 21 results in a point that has a fill and an outline. Shapes in R can have a value from 1-25. Shapes 1-20 can only accept a color aesthetic, but shapes 21-25 have both a color and a fill aesthetic. See the pch argument in par() for further discussion.

#A word about hexadecimal colours: Hexadecimal, literally "related to 16", is a base-16 alphanumeric counting system. Individual values come from the ranges 0-9 and A-F. This means there are 256 possible two-digit values (i.e. 00 - FF). Hexadecimal colours use this system to specify a six-digit code for Red, Green and Blue values ("#RRGGBB") of a colour (i.e. Pure blue: "#0000FF", black: "#000000", white: "#FFFFFF"). R can accept hex codes as valid colours.

# Define a hexadecimal color
my_color <- "#4ABEFF"

# Draw a scatter plot with color *aesthetic*
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +
geom_point()


# Same, but set color *attribute* in geom layer 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +
geom_point(color = my_color)




# Set the fill aesthetic; color, size and shape attributes
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) +
geom_point(size = 10, shape = 23, color = my_color)


```

##Using qplot
#gplot() allows for quick and dirty plots

# The old way (shown)
plot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars) # formula notation
with(mtcars, plot(wt, mpg)) # x, y notation

# Using ggplot:
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

# Using qplot:
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars)
```

```{r}
##Using aesthetics
#have to wrap the variable name in a factor() function to convert to a categorical variable

# basic qplot scatter plot:
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars)

# Categorical variable mapped onto size:
# cyl
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, size = factor(cyl))

# gear
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, size = factor(gear))

# Continuous variable mapped onto col:
# hp
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, color = hp)

# qsec
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, color = qsec)
```

#Choosing geoms, part 1 - how does gplot chooose???? which geom to use

qplot(factor(cyl), factor(vs), data = mtcars)

# qplot() with geom set to jitter manually
qplot(factor(cyl), factor(vs), data = mtcars, geom = "jitter")
```

```{r}
#Choosing geoms, part 2 -dotplot
#Scatter plots: Continous x, continous y
#Dot plots: categorical x, continous y

##Titanic

#sometimes you have to map to fill instead of color - for scatter plots you use color, for bar graphs you use fill?
